## BðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥M!!

FINALLY... IT'S ALIVE _AND_ IT HAS A PROPER HOME!!

And... This is how it all went down...

I addition to absolutely wrecking myself skating last month I also managed to corpse my very fucking kickarse phone in the process, and along with it all my 2FA login codes.

Most of them I had backed up however Cloudflare unfortunately wasn't one of the lucky ones. Since I only use cloudflare for DNS redirects I rarely have to actually log into the account. As such, I didn't even realise I was locked out until shortly after 3:31pm on fifteen days ago when I went tried to log in to sort out the subdomain for this site.

TBH I think I handled the situation remarkably well. There was definitely a time in my life where that sort of thing would have certainly led to this laptop being frisbeed point-blank at this brick wall.
